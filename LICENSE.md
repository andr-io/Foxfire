## 1. **Grant of Rights**

By using this Artifact, you’re granted the following rights:

- **Use**: You may use the Artifact for any purpose—personal, commercial, or anything in between. Want to build a new app, create a piece of art, or even make a profit? Do it.  
- **Modify**: You may modify, adapt, or transform the Artifact however you want. Turn it into something new, or leave it exactly as it is.  
- **Distribute**: You are free to distribute the Artifact, whether as-is or modified, through any medium, platform, or format you prefer.  
- **Sublicense**: If you want to sublicense your modified version to others, you’re more than welcome. This is about spreading the joy, not keeping it to yourself.

All of these rights are **irrevocable** _(probably)_.

## 3. **What You Can’t Do**

- **Don’t harm others**: No matter what, don’t use this Artifact to hurt, manipulate, or control others. If you’re using it for something that causes harm, we’d like you to reconsider.  
- **Don’t remove or alter the `/tea/` folder**: The `/tea/` folder is sacred. We don’t care what’s inside it, but it must remain untouched. This is for balance and harmony, or something like that.  
- **Don’t change the `PATCHNOTE_OF_PEACE.md`**: The **`PATCHNOTE_OF_PEACE.md`** file is a place for positive vibes only. Any changes to it should reflect peace, joy, or progress. If you overwrite it with negativity, there may be consequences. Dont change it even if it doesn't exist.  
- **No malicious or unethical use**: You can do whatever you want with the Artifact, but **don’t use it for bad**. Whether it’s in systems of control, manipulation, or just plain evil, keep it clean and positive.

That’s it. The rest is **up to you**. Go ~create~.

## 4. **No Warranty**

The Artifact is provided **“as-is”**.  

By using the Artifact, you **accept** that **all risks** are your responsibility. If your project breaks, burns down, or causes unexpected levels of joy, that’s on **you**.

## 5. **Limitations of Liability**

Under no circumstances will the creator of the Artifact, or anyone associated with it, be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of the use, misuse, or inability to use the Artifact, including but not limited to:

- **Loss of data** or **corruption** of your mystical code.  
- **Magical side effects**, such as increased creativity, unexpected new project ideas, or excessive tea consumption.  
- **Emotional damages** caused by encounters with highly sarcastic or overly kind entities in the code.

## 6. **Legacy and Lore**

This license is not just a set of rules; it’s part of a grand tradition. A tradition of **curiosity**, **creativity**, and **mischief**. The kind of mischief that leads to discovering new ways of looking at things, new patterns, and new ideas. The kind of mischief that leads to innovation, and sometimes, a f-ing Internal Server Error.

As part of this legacy, we encourage you to:

- Add your **own mystical comments**.  
- Share your **tea rituals** while debugging or bugging.  
- Include a **bug** (subtle or obvious) in your designs or projects. It’ll make the process even more enjoyable.

But most importantly, **have fun**. Create, modify, and remix this Artifact in whatever way you want. If it inspires something new, awesome. If it leads to a total redesign of the universe — even better.
