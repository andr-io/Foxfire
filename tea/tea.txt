Classic Tea Brewing:
1. Pick Your Tea:

    Loose-leaf tea (fancy and flavorful!) or tea bags (quick and easy).

    Choose your tea based on mood:

        Black Tea (e.g., Earl Grey, English Breakfast) for energy.

        Green Tea for a fresh, clean taste.

        Herbal Tea (e.g., chamomile, peppermint) for relaxation.

        Oolong Tea for something in between.

2. Boil the Water:

    Water temperature matters!

        For black tea, use boiling water (212°F or 100°C).

        For green tea, aim for a little below boiling (170°F-180°F or 77°C-82°C) to avoid bitterness.

        For herbal teas, boiling is fine as well.

    Use fresh water — avoid reheating old water for the best flavor.

3. Measure Your Tea:

    Loose-leaf tea: Use about 1 teaspoon per cup (8 oz/240 ml).

    Tea bags: Typically, 1 bag per cup.

    More leaves = stronger tea, fewer leaves = lighter flavor. Adjust according to taste.

4. Brewing Time:

    Black Tea: 3-5 minutes. Any longer and it might get bitter.

    Green Tea: 2-3 minutes. Over-brewing it makes it too astringent.

    Herbal Tea: 5-7 minutes (longer for stronger flavor).

    Oolong Tea: 4-6 minutes.

    Keep the lid on to trap heat and preserve the aroma.

5. Strain the Tea (if using loose-leaf):

    If you're brewing loose-leaf tea, use a tea strainer or infuser to catch the leaves.

6. Add-Ins (Optional):

    Sugar, honey, or sweeteners (to taste).

    Milk or cream for black tea (if you're feeling British!).

    Lemon slices or a sprig of mint for a fresh twist.

    A sprinkle of cinnamon or ginger for a little warmth.
